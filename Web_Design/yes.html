        The air in the university library was thick with the scent of old paper and the quiet hum of stressed-out students. Dharshyan was buried under a mountain of architecture blueprints, his fingers smudged with graphite. He was the kind of person who lived in the details—the exact angle of a cantilever, the precise shade of a sunset.

Then there was Gurvinder.

Gurvinder didn't do details; he did energy. He was a kinesiology major who seemed to vibrate at a higher frequency than everyone else. He had a habit of taking the seat directly across from Dharshyan every Tuesday, not to study, but to "aggressively hydrate" and look over his notes.

The Spark
It started with a misplaced ruler. Dharshyan had reached for his scale, only to find his hand landing on Gurvinder’s water bottle instead.

"Looking for this?" Gurvinder asked, a slow, teasing smirk spreading across his face as he held up the ruler.

Dharshyan felt a heat creep up his neck that had nothing to do with the library’s faulty heating system. "I need that for the floor plan. Precise measurements, Gurvinder. Some of us build things that shouldn't fall down."

"And some of us make sure the people inside those buildings stay fit enough to run down the stairs," Gurvinder countered, sliding the ruler back. His fingers lingered against Dharshyan’s for just a second too long. "You look like you haven't seen sunlight in three days, Dharsh. Come get coffee with me."

The Shift
Coffee turned into evening walks. Dharshyan found himself explaining the Golden Ratio, while Gurvinder would counter with the mechanics of a perfect sprint. They were opposites in every way—Dharshyan was a quiet symphony of thought; Gurvinder was a loud, joyful anthem.

One evening, while sitting on the bleachers overlooking the empty track, the silence between them changed. It wasn't the silence of two people with nothing to say, but the heavy, expectant silence of two people waiting for the other to move first.

"You spend all your time designing spaces for people to live in," Gurvinder whispered, leaning closer until their shoulders touched. "But you never seem to make space for yourself."

Dharshyan looked at him—really looked at him. He saw the way the stadium lights caught the gold in Gurvinder’s eyes. "I’m making space now," Dharshyan replied softly.

The Blueprint
Gurvinder didn't wait for a formal invitation. He reached out, his calloused hand cupping Dharshyan’s jaw, and pulled him into a kiss that tasted like cold air and peppermint. It wasn't a "precise measurement" or a "calculated move." It was messy, sudden, and perfect.

For the first time in his life, Dharshyan didn't care about the angles or the structural integrity of the moment. He just cared about the way Gurvinder’s heartbeat felt against his own.

Now, Dharshyan’s studio is a little different. There are still blueprints on the desk, but there’s also a pair of neon running shoes by the door and a water bottle that’s always full. They found that the best structures aren't made of steel or concrete—they’re built on the quiet Tuesdays when someone chooses to sit across from you and never leaves.</p>
